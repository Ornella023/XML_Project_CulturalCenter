# XML Project : Cultural Center

This project involves the creation of a cultural center (activities, events, ticket sales, etc.) using XML.
We created the XML file and its corresponding XML schema. We then developed 5 scenarios using XSLT stylesheets.
Additionally, we performed a transformation using the Python language.
All of the above was based on the XML tree and the fictitious activity schedule we previously established.
